I thought it was really cool when the Long War Perk Pack came out, adding an extra level to soldiers, and giving them a third perk option at each level. It made each class that much more diverse and interesting.

The trouble was, I rapidly found myself finding one build I liked with each class, and then building each soldier in the same way - with maybe the occasional variation, though that was mostly for variety's sake.

This is my attempt to fix my own personal issues by changing the way classes work. Now, diversity is enforced by means of splitting up the perk trees across several classes. Instead of just having the Specialist, who you can build for overwatch, hacking, or healing, we have the Medic, who focuses on healing with some overwatch, the Hacker, who focuses on hacking (duh), and the Combat Engineer, who has a lot of the random utility.

Not every class was so cleanly split. For example, one the Assault's descendents is the Field Scientist, who has lots of hacking and medical abilities. Or then there's a class like the Courser, who's kind of just their own thing, and can be built to either shine when taking on groups, or focus like a laser on their next target.

Every secondary weapon is used by three separate classes. I also made an effort to make sure no roles got put entirely in one class so that they'd only show up a third of the time; for example, like I said, while the Medic got most of the Specialist's medical abilities, some of those went to the Field Scientist and the Combat Engineer too.

As is probably obvious, this mod doesn't really fit with mods that add other classes, but it should be compatible with them. If you have one you're really gagging to use, let me know and I may add it in, or at least make a patch for it or something.

I definitely made this mod for myself first, and the community second. That doesn't mean I'm not open to feedback or requests, just that my priority is how I'll use it.

Big thanks to Pavonis and xylthixlm for Long War 2 and the Shadow Ops packs, as well as just for general modding support. XCOM 2 modding wouldn't exist like it currently does if not for Pavonis, and this mod definitely wouldn't exist without xylthixlm's spectacular XModBase.

Additional thanks to Lorc, Delapouite, Quoting, Skoll, Lord Berandas, and sbed from game-icons.net for most of the new icons.
